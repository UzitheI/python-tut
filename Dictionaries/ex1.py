#dictionaries help accessing data much easier

mycat={'name':'samantha','color':'grey'}

#one of the primary differences in lists and dictionaries is that the elements inside dictionaries are not ordered 

#when you compare a list with another list then the output will be false if done inside an interpreter shell 

#when you do that with a dictionary the value is returned to be true

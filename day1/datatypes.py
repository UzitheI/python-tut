#there is no need to define what variable type it is, python understands it on its own

a=5
name='jenifer'
surname='lopez'
marks=3423.3

print('The variable is ',a)
print('\n')
print("Now I'm going to concatenate the string:")
print(name + surname)
print('\n')
print('\nThe floating point number is ', marks)

#remember string concatenation cannot happen if one variable is a string and the other is a floating point number or an integer type

print('\n')
print("Now, I'm going to duplicate the string:")
print((name )*5)

print('* can be used for arithmetic multiplication and string replication')

#also non int type cannot replicate ie 5.0 cannot replicate the name



#storing values in variables

#it is like storing values inside a container 
cat ="jenifer"
#here it can be expressed as jenifer is inside teh variable cat
print(cat)

cat='micah'
print(cat)
#the variable cat stores jenifer until the variable is replaced


# a valid variable name 

current_balance=3423
currentBalance=234
#it is pretty similar to c++

#it is a python convention to write your variable name with a small letter at the start
